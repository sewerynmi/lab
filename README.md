# Lab

This repository is my personal engineering lab.

I’m a software engineer with an academic background in Advanced Computing.
This repository reflects my ongoing journey toward building complete systems, not just isolated applications.

In this lab I:

- prototype apps and test things

- experiment with automation and deployment strategies

- test new infrastructure and orchestration tools

- explore AI, machine learning, and retrieval-based systems

- validate architectural decisions in a controlled environment

- learn new things

- configure my home lab (quite few machines by now)


It’s a space for curiosity, experimentation, and technical depth.

If something here looks rough, that’s intentional. This is where ideas are tested before they mature.
